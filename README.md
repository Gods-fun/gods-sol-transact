# Solana GODS ðŸ¤–

This is a fork of the Eliza client repository with an improved Solana plug-in and a new character who handles all Solana based transactions: SBF.

WARNING: as of this fresh release, there are yet no confirmations before sending out SOL or SPL tokens, so make sure you are paying attention to everything the bot says.

Works with Twitter, too.

# Setup

Rename .env.example to .env

run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm build` to install dependencies and build the project.

run `pnpm start --character="characters/dobby.character.json"` to start the Solana Dobby bot.

run `pnpm start:client` to start the client.

Ask Dobby to send native SOL or SPL tokens.

Right now Dobby is limited to sending fixed amounts of native SOL and SPL tokens to a single recipient - me.
